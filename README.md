# Code Review - "Order Pizza" - Week 4 - Intro To Programming - Epicodus - Portland, OR

#### _This is a final project for the fourth week of the Intro to Programming course at Epicodus in Portland, June 11 - June 15, 2018_

#### By _**Kelli McCloskey**_

## Description

_The instructions for this project are as follows:_

#### Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

#### Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.


### Specifications

* Create a pizza with options for toppings and size.
* Create a list of available toppings with different prices for each topping.
* Create a list of sizes with different prices for each size.
* When a pizza is customized by the user, add costs of toppings and size to determine the price of the pizza.
* Display toppings, size and price of the pizza to the user.
